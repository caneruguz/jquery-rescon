This is a problem for making containers look good in small sizes as well, especially in cases of widgets or widget heavy sites like dashboards. \r\n\r\nThis plugin does something very simple. It gets the width of the container and readjusts the bootstrap classes. For instance if a page has .col-xs-12 and col-md-6; the script recognizes that although the page is wide the container is within xs width. So the script removes .col-md-6 so that only the xs style goes into effect. \r\n\r\nThis plugin also supports the bottom-up hierachy of bootstrap. If you define col-xs-6, all sizes higher than xs will also follow this. \r\n\r\nFor divs without any column information it falls back to standard 12 width column. \r\n\r\nThe script doesn't make any permanent changes and does not interfere with other classes in these elements. \r\n\r\n#### How to use it\r\nUse the plugin as with any other jquery plugin by adding it to the wrapper element that contains your sizable divs. \r\n\r\n```javascript \r\n$(document).ready(function(){\r\n    // Regular methods of doing it. Considering .rescon is the container for your columns\r\n      $(\".rescon\").rescon();\r\n    \r\n    // You can programmatically reset the plugin and take things back to their original state. This example uses a button click\r\n    $('#reset').on('click', function(){\r\n        $(\".rescon\").rescon({ action : \"reset\"});\r\n    })\r\n    \r\n    // And run it back again. \r\n    $('#run').on('click', function(){\r\n      $(\".rescon\").rescon({ action : \"run\"});\r\n    })\r\n    \r\n    // Add custom sizes\r\n    $(\".rescon\").rescon( { \r\n        sizes : { \"xs\" : 0, \"sm\" : 300, \"md\" : 600, \"lg\" : 1000 }\r\n    });\r\n        \r\n\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Download\r\nThe files you need to use are under /dist folder, there is a minified version as well. \r\n\r\n#### Demo\r\nDemo page coming soon. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
